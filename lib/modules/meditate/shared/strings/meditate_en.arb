It can be done sitting or lying downâ€”the important thing is to be comfortable. Once you are ready, take three breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth, slowly and deeply. Then, with your spine straight, your breathing soft and slow, and your eyes closed, feel the Peace and Harmony.",
